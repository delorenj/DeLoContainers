# AdGuard Home Expert Analysis & Implementation Strategy

## Executive Summary

As the AdGuard Expert Consultant, I have conducted comprehensive research on AdGuard Home deployment for DNS-based Roblox blocking in home network environments. This analysis covers Docker deployment, Traefik integration, security considerations, and specific Roblox domain blocking strategies.

## Current Environment Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Traefik v3.3** reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL
- **Docker Compose v2** ecosystem with external proxy network
- **Domain**: `delo.sh` with automatic HTTPS redirection
- **Port Strategy**: AdGuard mapped to `8512:80` to avoid Traefik conflicts

### Current AdGuard Configuration Status
- Basic container setup with Traefik labels configured
- DNS ports 53/udp and 53/tcp exposed
- Volumes configured for persistence: `./conf` and `./work`
- Proper network integration with external proxy network

## Critical DNS Filtering Capabilities

### Roblox Domain Blocking Strategy

Based on extensive research, effective Roblox blocking requires targeting multiple domains:

#### Primary Domains (Essential for Blocking)
```
||roblox.com^
||rbxcdn.com^
||web.roblox.com^
```

#### Secondary Domains (Comprehensive Blocking)
```
||rbx.com^
||robloxcdn.com^
||robloxlabs.com^
||roblox.gg^
```

#### CDN and Asset Domains
```
||c0.rbxcdn.com^
||c1.rbxcdn.com^
||c2.rbxcdn.com^
||c3.rbxcdn.com^
||t0.rbxcdn.com^
||t1.rbxcdn.com^
||t2.rbxcdn.com^
||t3.rbxcdn.com^
||t4.rbxcdn.com^
||t5.rbxcdn.com^
||t6.rbxcdn.com^
||t7.rbxcdn.com^
```

### DNS Rewrite Rules Configuration
```yaml
rewrites:
  - domain: roblox.com
    answer: 127.0.0.1
  - domain: "*.rbxcdn.com"
    answer: 127.0.0.1
  - domain: web.roblox.com
    answer: 127.0.0.1
```

## Docker Deployment Best Practices

### Recommended Configuration Enhancements

```yaml
services:
  adguard:
    image: adguard/adguardhome:latest
    container_name: adguard
    hostname: adguard
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/opt/adguardhome/conf
      - ./work:/opt/adguardhome/work
    ports:
      # DNS (Critical - Port 53 required)
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "53:53/tcp"
      # Web UI via Traefik (avoid port 80 conflict)
      - "8512:80/tcp"
    environment:
      - AGH_CONFIG=/opt/adguardhome/conf/AdGuardHome.yaml
    networks:
      - proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.adguard.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.adguard.rule=Host(`adguard.delo.sh`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.adguard.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.adguard.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
      - "traefik.http.services.adguard.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
```

### Critical Security Configurations

#### DNS Security Settings
```yaml
filtering:
  protection_enabled: true
  filtering_enabled: true
  blocking_mode: "nxdomain"
  blocked_response_ttl: 10
  parental_block_host: "family-block.adguard-dns.io"
  safebrowsing_block_host: "standard-block.adguard-dns.io"
```

#### Anti-DDoS Protection
```yaml
ratelimit: 20
ratelimit_whitelist: ["192.168.0.0/16", "10.0.0.0/8", "127.0.0.1"]
refuse_any: true
```

#### DNSSEC and Privacy
```yaml
enable_dnssec: true
aaaa_disabled: false  # Keep IPv6 unless specifically needed to block
anonymize_client_ip: false  # For home network, logging useful for debugging
```

## Upstream DNS Configuration

### Recommended Upstream Servers
```yaml
upstream_dns:
  - tls://dns.adguard-dns.io
  - tls://1.1.1.1
  - https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
  - tls://dns.quad9.net

upstream_mode: "load_balance"
bootstrap_dns:
  - 9.9.9.9
  - 149.112.112.112
```

### Family Protection Integration
```yaml
upstream_dns:
  - tls://family.adguard-dns.io  # Built-in family protection
  - https://doh.familyshield.opendns.com/dns-query
```

## Traefik Integration Analysis

### Current Integration Status: ✅ APPROVED

The existing Traefik configuration is well-architected:

1. **Port Management**: Correctly uses port 8512 for web UI to avoid conflicts
2. **SSL Termination**: Proper HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
3. **Network Isolation**: Uses external proxy network appropriately
4. **Service Discovery**: Traefik labels correctly configured

### DNS Resolution Priority
- AdGuard must handle DNS (port 53) directly
- Traefik handles HTTPS termination for web UI
- No DNS queries should route through Traefik

## Security Considerations

### Home Network Deployment

#### Network-Level Security
1. **DNS Port Security**: Only AdGuard should bind to port 53
2. **Interface Binding**: Consider binding DNS to specific interfaces
3. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure only local network can reach DNS

#### Container Security
```yaml
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
user: "1000:1000"  # Run as non-root user
read_only: true
tmpfs:
  - /tmp
```

#### Configuration Security
- Store configuration in version control
- Regular backup of AdGuardHome.yaml
- Monitor for configuration drift

### DNS Security
1. **Upstream Security**: Use DoT/DoH for upstream queries
2. **Query Logging**: Enable for security monitoring
3. **Blocklist Management**: Auto-update enabled filters
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DNS amplification attacks

## Performance Optimization

### Cache Configuration
```yaml
cache_size: 4194304  # 4MB cache
cache_ttl_min: 600   # 10 minutes minimum
cache_ttl_max: 86400 # 24 hours maximum
```

### Resource Limits
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 256M
      cpus: '0.5'
    reservations:
      memory: 128M
      cpus: '0.25'
```

    name: "AdGuard DNS filter"
  - enabled: true
    url: "https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts"
    name: "Dan Pollock's hosts file"
```

### Parental Control Integration
```yaml
