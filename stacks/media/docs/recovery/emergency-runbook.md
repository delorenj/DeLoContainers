## üîß RECOVERY PROCEDURES BY SCENARIO

### Scenario A: Admin Lockout (Most Common)
**Symptoms**: Can access web interface but cannot login
**Data Risk**: üü¢ None
**Downtime**: 5-10 minutes

#### Steps:
1. **Locate Reset Button**: Usually on back panel

   ```bash
   # While system is powered ON
   Press and hold RESET for 4 seconds
   Release when you hear BEEP
   Wait for blue LED to become solid
   ```
3. **Reconnect**:
   ```bash
   # Find new IP address
   Use Synology Assistant or check DHCP leases
   Access: http://[NEW_IP]:5000
   Login: admin (no password)
   ```
4. **Reconfigure**:
   - Set new admin password
   - Configure network settings
   - Re-enable services as needed

### Scenario B: Network Configuration Issues
**Symptoms**: Cannot reach web interface, device appears online
**Data Risk**: üü¢ None
**Downtime**: 10-15 minutes

#### Steps:
1. **Physical Reset**:
   ```bash
   Power cycle the device
   Execute Mode 1 Reset (4 seconds)
   ```
2. **Network Discovery**:
   ```bash
   # Use Synology Assistant
   Download from: global.download.synology.com
   Launch ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Connect to discovered device

   # Or manual discovery
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -i synology
   arp -a | grep -i synology
   ```
3. **Reconfigure Network**:
   - Access via Assistant or temporary IP
   - Set correct static IP or DHCP
   - Verify DNS and gateway settings

### Scenario C: DSM Corruption
**Symptoms**: Boot loops, partial services, HTTP 500 errors
**Data Risk**: üü° Low (data preserved)
**Downtime**: 30-60 minutes

#### Steps:
1. **Backup Critical Config** (if accessible):
   ```bash
   # Via SSH if available
   sudo tar -czf /tmp/config-backup.tar.gz /etc/synoconf.d/
   ```
2. **Execute Mode 2 Reset**:
   ```bash
   # While system is powered ON
   Press and hold RESET for 10 seconds
   Release after 3 consecutive BEEPS
   Wait for orange blinking LED
   ```
3. **Reinstall DSM**:
   ```bash
   # Access Web Assistant: http://[IP]:5000
   Download latest DSM .pat file
   Upload and install (30-45 minutes)
   ```
4. **Restore Configuration**:
   - Import backed-up settings
   - Recreate user accounts
   - Reconfigure services

### Scenario D: Hardware Failure Suspected
**Symptoms**: No boot, unusual LED patterns, disk errors
**Data Risk**: üü† High
**Downtime**: 1-4 hours

#### Steps:
1. **Enter Safe Mode**:
   ```bash
   Power OFF completely
   Hold RESET while powering ON
   Continue holding for 10+ seconds
   Release when STATUS LED blinks orange rapidly
   ```
2. **Diagnostic Access**:
   ```bash
   # Serial console (if available)
   Connect USB-to-Serial adapter
   115200 8N1 settings
   Boot and interrupt with Ctrl+C
   ```
3. **Data Recovery Priority**:
   ```bash
   # Mount volumes read-only
   sudo mount -o ro /dev/md2 /volume1

   # Check file system integrity
   sudo fsck -n /dev/md0  # read-only check

   # Extract critical data
   sudo cp -r /volume1/critical_data /tmp/rescue/
   ```

### Scenario E: Complete System Failure
**Symptoms**: No response, no LEDs, no network activity
**Data Risk**: üî¥ Critical
**Downtime**: 4-24 hours

#### Steps:
1. **Hardware Verification**:
   ```bash
   Check power supply (LED on adapter)
   Test with different power cable
   Verify power button responsiveness
   Check for obvious physical damage
   ```
2. **Emergency Data Access**:
   ```bash
   # Remove drives carefully
   # Install in USB-SATA adapter
   # Mount on recovery system
   # RAID configuration may require special tools
   ```
3. **Professional Recovery**:
   - Contact Synology support immediately
   - Prepare for potential RMA process
   - Consider professional data recovery services
