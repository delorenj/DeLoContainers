## üìä Risk Assessment Framework

### Data Integrity Levels
- üü¢ **Safe**: Configuration changes only, no data at risk
- üü° **Caution**: Service interruption, minimal data risk
- üü† **Warning**: Potential data loss, backup verification required
- üî¥ **Danger**: High data loss risk, professional assistance recommended

### Business Impact Categories
- **P1 Critical**: Production down, revenue impact
- **P2 High**: Internal services affected
- **P3 Medium**: Non-essential services
- **P4 Low**: Development/testing systems

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Document Maintenance Schedule
- **Weekly**: Review for accuracy during incidents
- **Monthly**: Update contact information and procedures
- **Quarterly**: Full documentation review and testing
- **Annually**: Complete procedure validation and team training

### Version Control
All recovery documentation is version controlled and follows these conventions:
- **Major versions**: Significant procedure changes
- **Minor versions**: Updates to existing procedures
- **Patch versions**: Corrections and clarifications

### Testing Requirements
Recovery procedures should be tested in non-production environments:
- **Monthly**: Basic reset procedures
- **Quarterly**: Complete recovery scenarios
- **Annually**: Full disaster recovery simulation
