echo "========================="

echo "1. Host mount ownership:"

echo "4. Current NFS mount options:"

echo "üîß WHAT THE FIX WILL DO:"
echo "======================="

echo "1. SERVER-SIDE (Synology NFS Export):"
echo "   Current: Default export without UID mapping"
echo "   Fixed:   /volume1/video *(rw,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,...)"

echo "2. CLIENT-SIDE (Mount Options):"
echo "   Current: Basic NFS4 mount"
echo "   Fixed:   mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000,... (forces ownership)"

echo "3. RESULT AFTER FIX:"
echo "   Host /mnt/video:     1000:1000 ‚úÖ"

echo "   Write permissions:   Working   ‚úÖ"
echo "   Container logs:      No errors ‚úÖ"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ HOW TO APPLY THE FIX:"
echo "======================="
echo ""

echo "Method 1 - Automated (Recommended):"
echo "   1. SSH to NAS: ssh admin@192.168.1.50"
echo "   2. On NAS: ./synology-nfs-config.sh"
echo "   3. On host: ./scripts/fix-nfs-client.sh"
echo "   4. Test: ./scripts/test-nfs-permissions.sh qbittorrent"
echo ""

echo "Method 2 - Manual DSM:"
echo "   1. DSM > Control Panel > Shared Folder"
echo "   2. Select 'video' > Edit > NFS Permissions"
echo "   3. Add rule: 192.168.1.0/24, Read/Write, Map all users to admin"
echo "   4. On host: ./scripts/fix-nfs-client.sh"
echo ""

echo "Method 3 - Quick Manual Fix:"
echo "   1. On host: sudo umount /mnt/video"
echo "   2. Mount with options:"
echo "      sudo mount -t nfs4 -o rw,vers=4.1,uid=1000,gid=1000,rsize=131072,wsize=131072 \\"
echo "        192.168.1.50:/volume1/video /mnt/video"
echo "   3. Update /etc/fstab for persistence"
echo ""

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WHY THIS PROBLEM EXISTS:"
echo "=========================="
echo "- LinuxServer.io containers use UID 911 by default"
echo "- NFS exports without UID mapping show server-side ownership"
echo "- Docker PUID/PGID only affects internal container behavior"
echo "- Mount-level UID mapping fixes ownership interpretation"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SAFETY GUARANTEES:"
echo "===================="
echo "- No system user modifications on Synology"
echo "- Standard NFS configuration methods only"
echo "- All changes include automatic backups"
echo "- Can be safely reverted if needed"
echo ""

echo "üéØ EXPECTED TIMELINE:"
echo "===================="
echo "- Server configuration: 2-5 minutes"
echo "- Client remount: 30 seconds"
echo "- Validation: 30 seconds"
echo "- Total time: < 10 minutes"
