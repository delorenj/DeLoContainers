# 🎯 AdGuard + Tailscale Integration - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ System Status: OPERATIONAL

**AdGuard Home**: https://adguard.delo.sh  
**Tailscale IP**: 100.66.29.76  
**DNS Service**: Port 5353 (UDP/TCP)  
**Web Interface**: Port 3000 → Traefik HTTPS

---

## 🚀 Final Integration Steps

### 1. Complete AdGuard Initial Setup
1. Visit: **https://adguard.delo.sh**
2. Complete the setup wizard:
   - Set admin username/password  
   - Configure DNS settings
   - Enable filtering

### 2. Configure Tailscale Global Nameserver

**In Tailscale Admin Console:**
1. Go to: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns
2. Under **Global nameservers**, click **Add nameserver**
3. Enter: `100.66.29.76` (port 5353 auto-detected)
4. Enable **"Override local DNS"** ✅
5. Keep **MagicDNS** enabled ✅
6. Save configuration

### 3. DNS Flow Architecture
```
Tailnet Device → Tailscale MagicDNS → AdGuard (100.66.29.76:5353) → Upstream DNS
```

**What this achieves:**
- ✅ All Tailnet traffic filtered through AdGuard
- ✅ Roblox domains blocked network-wide
- ✅ MagicDNS still works for .ts.net domains
- ✅ Secure DNS over Tailscale tunnel
- ✅ Works on any network (home, mobile, public Wi-Fi)

## 🧪 Validation Tests

After completing Tailscale DNS configuration:

### Test 1: Basic DNS Resolution
```bash
# From any Tailnet device
nslookup google.com
# Should resolve through AdGuard at 100.66.29.76
```

### Test 2: Roblox Blocking
```bash
# These should be blocked/filtered
nslookup roblox.com
nslookup rbxcdn.com
nslookup web.roblox.com
```

### Test 3: Tailscale MagicDNS
```bash
# Should still work for .ts.net domains
nslookup big-chungus.burro-salmon.ts.net
```
