# 🎯 Final Testing Instructions for AdGuard Custom Redirect

## ✅ Fix Applied Successfully!

The network accessibility issue has been resolved. AdGuard is now configured to redirect blocked requests to `192.168.1.12:8888` instead of the unreachable container IP.

## 🧪 How to Test from a Filtered Device

### Step 1: Test DNS Resolution
From any device that uses AdGuard as its DNS server (NOT big-chungus):

```bash
nslookup roblox.com
```

**Expected result**: Should return `192.168.1.12` instead of the real Roblox IP

### Step 2: Test HTTP Redirect
```bash
curl -v http://roblox.com/
```

**Expected result**: Should connect and return HTML redirect page

### Step 3: Test in Browser
1. Open a web browser on the filtered device
2. Navigate to: `http://roblox.com/`
3. **Expected result**: 
   - See countdown page with "Content Blocked" message
   - After 3 seconds, automatically redirect to `https://nope.delo.sh?sound=true&blocked=roblox.com`
   - Your landing page should load with sound enabled! 🔊

## 🎭 Alternative Test Domains

If Roblox isn't blocked, try these domains:
- `facebook.com`
- `instagram.com`
- `tiktok.com`
- `youtube.com` (if blocked)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If DNS test fails (doesn't return 192.168.1.12):
- Check if the device is actually using AdGuard as DNS server
- Verify the domain is in AdGuard's block lists
- Check AdGuard admin panel: Settings > DNS Settings > Blocking mode = "Custom IP"

### If DNS works but HTTP hangs:
- Test direct access: `curl http://192.168.1.12:8888/`
- Check firewall settings on big-chungus
- Verify redirect service is running: `docker compose ps`

### If redirect page shows but doesn't redirect:
- Check if `https://nope.delo.sh?sound=true` is accessible from the client
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try manual URL: `http://roblox.com/?immediate=true` for instant redirect

## 📊 Monitoring

### Watch AdGuard Logs:
```bash
cd /home/delorenj/docker/trunk-main/stacks/utils/adguard
docker compose logs adguard --follow
```

### Watch Redirect Service Logs:
```bash
docker compose logs adguard-redirect --follow
```

### Check Service Health:
```bash
./debug-redirect.sh
```
