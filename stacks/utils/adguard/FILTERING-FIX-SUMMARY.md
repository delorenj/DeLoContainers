# AdGuard Home Filtering Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
AdGuard Home was experiencing filtering errors due to an improperly configured custom filter:

```
[error] filtering: changing last modified time err="chtimes /opt/adguardhome/work/data/filters/9999.txt: no such file or directory"
[error] filtering: updating filter url=file://opt/adguardhome/filters/roblox-block.txt err="reading from url: Get \"file://opt/adguardhome/filters/roblox-block.txt\": unsupported protocol scheme \"file\""
```

## Root Cause
1. **Unsupported Protocol**: AdGuard Home doesn't support `file://` URLs for filter sources
2. **Missing Filter File**: The system was looking for `/opt/adguardhome/work/data/filters/9999.txt` which didn't exist
3. **Configuration Issue**: The Roblox filter was configured with a local file path instead of an HTTP URL

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed Problematic Filter**: Eliminated the filter with ID 9999 that used `file://` protocol
2. **Migrated to User Rules**: Moved all 39 Roblox blocking rules to the `user_rules` section
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All Roblox domains remain blocked as intended

## Files Modified
- `/opt/adguardhome/conf/AdGuardHome.yaml` - Main configuration
- Created backup: `AdGuardHome.yaml.backup-fix`

## Rules Migrated
The following Roblox domains are now blocked via user rules:
- Primary domains: `roblox.com`, `rbxcdn.com`, `web.roblox.com`
- Subdomains: `www.roblox.com`, `m.roblox.com`, `blog.roblox.com`, etc.
- CDN domains: `robloxcdn.com`, `rbx.com`, `robloxlabs.com`
- API services: `api.roblox.com`, `auth.roblox.com`, etc.
- Total: 39 blocking rules

## Verification
- ✅ No more filtering errors in logs
- ✅ AdGuard Home starts cleanly
- ✅ DNS proxy services running on port 53
- ✅ Web interface accessible on port 3000
- ✅ All Roblox blocking rules active

## Future Recommendations
1. **Use HTTP URLs**: For custom filters, host them via HTTP/HTTPS
2. **User Rules**: For small rule sets, use user_rules directly
3. **Public Lists**: Prefer established public filter lists when available

## Script Created
`fix-roblox-filter.py` - Automated the migration process and can be reused for similar issues.
