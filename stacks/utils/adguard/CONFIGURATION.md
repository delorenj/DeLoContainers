# AdGuard Home Configuration Guide
*Hive Mind Collective Intelligence - Final Configuration Steps*

## 🎯 System Status
**DEPLOYED** ✅ - AdGuard Home is running at https://adguard.delo.sh

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration Required

Since initial configuration needs to be done through the web interface, follow these steps:

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Visit: https://adguard.delo.sh
2. Complete the initial setup wizard
3. Set admin credentials
4. Configure DNS settings

### 2. Apply Expert-Approved Roblox Blocking

**Go to Settings → DNS Settings and add these DNS rewrites:**
```
roblox.com → 127.0.0.1
*.rbxcdn.com → 127.0.0.1
web.roblox.com → 127.0.0.1
*.roblox.com → 127.0.0.1
```

**Go to Filters → DNS Blocklists and add:**
- Name: "Roblox Comprehensive Block (Hive Mind)"
- URL: Copy content from `/filters/roblox-block.txt`

### 3. Security & Performance Settings

**DNS Settings:**
```
Upstream DNS servers:
- tls://family.adguard-dns.io
- tls://1.1.1.1
- https://doh.familyshield.opendns.com/dns-query

Bootstrap DNS:
- 9.9.9.10
- 149.112.112.10

Upstream mode: Load balancing
Enable DNSSEC: ✅
Blocking mode: NXDOMAIN
```

**Security Settings:**
```
Rate limiting: 20 requests/sec
Block malware/phishing: ✅
Enable safe browsing: ✅
Block adult content: ✅ (optional for family protection)
```

## 🧪 Validation Tests

After configuration, test the blocking:

```bash
# These should return NXDOMAIN or 127.0.0.1:
nslookup roblox.com localhost
nslookup rbxcdn.com localhost
nslookup web.roblox.com localhost
nslookup c0.rbxcdn.com localhost
```

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- The system is currently accessible via https://adguard.delo.sh
- For maximum security, consider restricting access to Tailscale only
- DNS service is bound to port 53 for local network use
- All connections are encrypted via Traefik SSL termination

## 📊 Monitoring

**Check DNS Query Log:**
- Go to Query Log in AdGuard interface
- Monitor for Roblox domain queries
- Verify blocking is working effectively

**Health Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check container health
docker compose ps

# View real-time logs
docker compose logs -f adguard
```
