### Fixed
- **Critical Session Management Bug for Prompts**

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-25

### Changed
- Switched from pnpm to npm for dependency management
- Updated Dockerfile to use `npm ci` instead of `pnpm install`
- Updated .dockerignore to exclude pnpm-lock.yaml and include package-lock.json

### Fixed
- Resolved "pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date" error during Docker builds

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **Streamable HTTP Transport Support**: The proxy can now connect to downstream MCP servers that use the Streamable HTTP transport protocol

  - Web-based access from browsers and HTTP clients
  - Remote connections over the network
  - Stateless mode for scalable deployments
  - Session-based stateful mode for efficient multi-request operations
- **Authentication for HTTP Mode**: Optional Bearer token authentication for Streamable HTTP endpoints
