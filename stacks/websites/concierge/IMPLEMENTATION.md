# Concierge Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The Concierge AI Gateway has been successfully implemented and deployed in the websites stack with the following components:

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure

1. **Docker Service Configuration**
   - Deno-based TypeScript server running on Alpine Linux
   - Traefik integration with SSL/TLS termination
   - Health checks and container monitoring
   - Environment variable configuration

2. **Network & Security**
   - Connected to `proxy` network for Traefik routing
   - API key authentication via `X-API-Token` header
   - CORS configuration for web client access
   - Rate limiting via Traefik middleware

### 🚀 API Endpoints

1. **Health Monitoring** (`GET /health`)
   - Service status and version information
   - Dependency health checks (OpenRouter, Memory services)
   - JSON response with timestamp

2. **Hello Endpoints** (`GET /hello`)
   - Public access: Returns `{"message": "world"}`
   - Authenticated: Returns `{"message": "hello, jarad"}`
   - Demonstrates authentication flow

3. **LLM Proxy** (`POST /llm`)
   - Direct integration with OpenRouter API
   - Support for multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, etc.)
   - Streaming and non-streaming responses
   - Request/response logging

4. **WebSocket Support** (`WS /ws`)
   - Real-time bidirectional communication
   - Authentication required
   - Message echo functionality (extensible)

### 🔧 Development Tools

1. **Test Suite** (`test.sh`)
   - Automated testing of all endpoints
   - Authentication verification
   - Error handling validation
   - Integration test coverage

2. **Web Test Client** (`test-client.html`)
   - Interactive browser-based testing interface
   - Real-time WebSocket testing
   - LLM request interface
   - Configuration management

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with API reference
   - PRD (Product Requirements Document)
   - Implementation guide
   - Service directory integration

### 🌐 Deployment & Access

- **URL**: https://concierge.delo.sh
- **SSL**: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates via Traefik
- **Authentication**: `CONCIERGE_API_KEY=concierge-api-key-secure-token-2025`
- **Container**: Running as `concierge` with restart policies

## ✅ Verification Results

All integration tests pass:
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding
- ✅ Public hello endpoint working
- ✅ Authenticated hello endpoint working
- ✅ LLM proxy functioning with OpenRouter
- ✅ Unauthorized access properly blocked (401)
- ✅ Invalid endpoints return 404

## 🔮 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on the PRD, the following features are planned:

1. **MCP Server Orchestration**
   - Spawn and manage MCP server instances
   - Integration with AmazonQ, Cursor, Claude MCP servers
   - Task delegation between AI assistants

2. **Enhanced Streaming**
   - Server-sent events for LLM streaming
   - WebSocket-based real-time AI interactions
   - Progress tracking for long-running tasks

3. **Specialized Agents**
   - Project Manager Agent with Trello integration
   - Vector-based memory via OpenMemory MCP
   - Context switching between agents

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- [x] Simple HTTP endpoints working with Traefik labels
- [x] WebSocket connection establishes successfully
- [x] Can proxy requests to OpenRouter
- [x] Basic authentication via API key
- [x] Health monitoring and status reporting
- [x] CORS configuration for web clients
- [x] Comprehensive testing and documentation

## 🔐 Security Features

- API key-based authentication
- CORS headers for web client security
- Rate limiting via Traefik
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Environment variable-based secrets
- Input validation and error handling

The Concierge service is now fully operational and ready to serve as the foundation for advanced AI agent orchestration and LLM interactions.
