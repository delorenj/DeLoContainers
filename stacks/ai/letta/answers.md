1. Hm, maybe i'm giving this thing too much credit. For agent creation, i want that managed elsewhere in my ecosystem (AgentForge maybe?)

2. I really imagine this interface as my main Memory Management tool.

- For a given agent, see a log of their threads by session and datetime
- See the contents of existing custom memory blocks (i.e. family data like kids names and ages, personal goals short-term and long-term, likes and dislikes, whatever else i want to add.)

3. Might as well build directly into Holocene - but i didn't even start holocene implementation yet. I think your goal will be to go to the TheBoard and hold a product and design planning session retreat. Something we can then proudly handoff to the Holocene team.

> Note: Since this will be our first 33GOD-focused board meeting, we'll first need to bang our heads together and build the perfect diverse set of domain expertise we want to hire on to our board.
