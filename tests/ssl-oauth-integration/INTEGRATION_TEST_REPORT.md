## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Recommended

1. **Enable OCSP Stapling**
   ```yaml
   # In Traefik configuration
   certificatesResolvers:
     letsencrypt:
       acme:
         ocspMustStaple: true
   ```

2. **Configure HTTP to HTTPS Redirects**
   ```yaml
   # Ensure all services redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   middlewares:
     https-redirect:
       redirectScheme:
         scheme: https
   ```

3. **Implement Security Headers**
   ```yaml
   middlewares:
     security-headers:
       headers:
         customRequestHeaders:
           Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
           X-Frame-Options: "DENY"
           X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"
   ```

### Long-term Security Enhancements

1. **Certificate Monitoring**
   - Implement automated certificate expiration alerts
   - Set up 30-day and 7-day expiration warnings
   - Monitor certificate transparency logs

2. **OAuth Security Hardening**
   - Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
   - Enable OAuth state validation
   - Configure proper redirect URI validation
   - Implement rate limiting on OAuth endpoints

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable HTTP/2 across all services
   - Implement caching headers
   - Optimize cipher suite selection
   - Configure SSL session resumption

## Automated Testing Integration
