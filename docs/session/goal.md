# Goal

Let's address these single points of failure

## Problem

Looking at the core/compose.yml file, you're absolutely right about this architectural observation. Let me break down why this is a critical point:

1. Traefik Dependency:
- Traefik is your reverse proxy and handles all external traffic routing
- If Traefik goes down, no external traffic can reach any service, including Portainer
- This makes it a single point of failure for external access
- Port 80 and 443 are bound directly to Traefik, so no other service can take over routing

2. Portainer Dependency:
- Portainer depends on Traefik (as seen in `depends_on: - traefik`)
- If Portainer goes down, you can't use its web interface to manage/fix containers
- More critically, without Portainer's interface, fixing Portainer itself becomes more challenging
- The deploy hook system appears to rely on Portainer's API

This creates a "chicken and egg" problem:
- If Traefik fails, you can't access Portainer to fix it
- If Portainer fails, using its UI to fix either service becomes impossible


## Solution

Some suggestions to improve resilience:

1. Consider having a fallback direct access method:
```yaml
portainer:
  ports:
    - "9443:9443"  # Fallback direct HTTPS port
```

2. Keep docker-compose and docker CLI access ready as alternative management tools

3. Document manual recovery procedures that don't rely on Portainer's UI

4. Consider implementing health checks and automatic recovery scripts that don't depend on either service

5. Maintain backup configurations and document manual deployment steps for both core services
